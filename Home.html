            <p>Welcome to my online portfolio where you will find my personal and non-personal works, ranging from drawings to articles and game reviews that I have made,
              you can view them at the projects page which consists of drawings, videos of the drawing process, game reviews of games that I have playedand movie/film reviews that 
              dive deep into the movie/film.

                <h1>About This Website</h1>
                <p>This website is a portfolio of my works and projects, personal and non-personal,
                  this helps me to not organize my work but to also allow for people and employers to see my sample works in one convenient place.
                  I also wanted it to be a place to contain different works that I plan on doing in the near future for now it will be
                  a portfolio of of my personal and professional projects. Right now the content available for viewing are drawings, which have a video of the drawing process and pictures for better viewing and
                  a game review and film review which you can read, these are the only works and projects that I have put here for now but in the near future it will be expanded. This website itself 
                  is also a project of mine as it shows my skills in web development which I aim to be a side career of mine, its also a good skill to learn in this day and age.
                  <br><br>
